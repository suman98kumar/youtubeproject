Channel information (subscribers, views, upload dates)
Video details (title, description, tags, comments)
Viewer engagement metrics (likes, dislikes, shares)
Data Storage: Discover efficient ways to store your harvested data using a combination of:
MongoDB: A flexible NoSQL database for handling large, unstructured data sets.
SQL data warehouse: A structured and optimized storage solution for advanced analysis.
Streamlit Application: Develop a user-friendly interface to:
Search and select desired channels/videos.
Visualize harvested data through charts and graphs.
Perform basic data analysis and exploration.
